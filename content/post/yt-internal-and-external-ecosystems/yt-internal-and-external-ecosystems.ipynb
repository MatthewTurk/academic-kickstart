More specifically, though, what it seemed to me was that it was a talk more about an opportunity to avoid fragmentation and think more carefully about how arrays and APIs are thought of and used.  That got me thinking about something I've kind of touched on in previous posts ([here](https://matthewturk.github.io/post/refactoring-yt-frontends-part1/), [here](https://matthewturk.github.io/post/refactoring-yt-frontends-part2/) and [here](https://matthewturk.github.io/post/refactoring-yt-frontends-part3/)) -- basically, that yt is pretty monolithic, and that's not really the best way to evolve with the ecosystem.\n",
