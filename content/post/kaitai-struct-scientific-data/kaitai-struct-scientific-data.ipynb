    "# Fun with Kaitai Struct\n",
    "\n",
    "**tl;dr**: kaitai struct is awesome.\n",
    "\n",
    "File formats can be pretty annoying -- *especially* when you figure them out through weird combinations of reverse-engineering, hand-me-down code and trial-and-error.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've ended up with in yt is a bunch of data formats where the process of conducting the IO is all mixed up with the description of that IO.  This means that any attempt to update things (which I've alluded to in [these](https://matthewturk.github.io/post/refactoring-yt-frontends-part1/) [blog](https://matthewturk.github.io/post/refactoring-yt-frontends-part2/) [posts](https://matthewturk.github.io/post/refactoring-yt-frontends-part3/)) requires a fair bit of care to make sure that the process is not disruptive in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation for this, I set out to start writing down some of the file formats in a flat text format by going through my old notes and the code in the various yt `io.py` files.  Before too long, I decided to instead start utilizing [kaitai struct](kaitai.io) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've found Kaitai struct to be useful in other projects -- for instance, I have been using it as a method to reverse engineer the data files from an old DOS game I used to play with my brother back in the early 90s.  The combination of the simple (but reasonably flexible) syntax, the ruby-based [visualizer](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_visualizer) and the [WebIDE](https://ide.kaitai.io) make it really good for exploratory reverse engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, it generates code!  You can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ksc -t python somefile.ksy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and it'll generate a python reader.  It can also generate javascript, java, go, etc, and I think rust is in the works.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question became: could we use kaitai struct for documenting a data format like, say, the binary format from [GADGET-2](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/)?  After that we can really stretch our legs and try it on more complicated ones, but let's start with this one."

    "## Gadget-2 Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The (vanilla) Gadget-2 data format is reasonably straightforward, and it's even described in some detail in the Gadget manual.  You have a header, then sets of records.  Each of these sets of records has a separating value (sometimes!).  According to table 3 in the user guide, the file looks something like: \n",
    "\n",
    " * Header\n",
    " * Position\n",
    " * Velocity\n",
    " * ID\n",
    " * Mass (only for variable mass particles)\n",
    " * Energy (only for gas particles)\n",
    " * Density (Only for gas particles)\n",
    " * Smoothing length (Only for gas particles)\n",
    " * Potential (if enabled in makefile)\n",
    " * Acceleration (if enabled in makefile)\n",
    " * Endtime (if enabled in makefile)\n",
    " * Timestep (if enabled in makefile)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gadget-2 is probably the most widely-used astrophysics simulation code, but one of its defining characteristics is that it is quite readily hackable to include additional parameters, additional particle attributes, and lots more physics.  This usually means that when you receive binary gadget data, you need to know what to expect in the file -- the individual file formats are typically not self-describing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header is often left unchanged, at least in the data I've seen.  In yt we have a simple specification system to allow for modifications to both the fields and the header, but the \"vanilla\" header looks something like this (in python [struct](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) notation):\n",

    "In its simplest form, Kaitai specifications allow specifying the format of data and the order that different types of data will arrive in.  The base data types it has are standard numerical data types, bytes, strings, arrays and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaitai has a little bit of metadata we will add at the beginning, so we start with this preamble:\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wanted to build a parser for the header, the most obvious thing we could do would be to parse the different items in order.  The very first item is an array of 6 integers that describes the number of particles in the simulation, separated by each particle type.  This comes in a sequence starting at the beginning of our \"stream,\" so we can use the `seq` top-level type to start parsing:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`recsize_0` here is because we know that our header will be preceded by a value indicating how many bytes are in it -- this is a common practice, but not universal.  And I've said that each of the variables (`npart1` ... `npart6`) is of type `u4`, which means \"unsigned four byte integers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't that efficient, though -- each particle type has its own variable.  KS provides us with the option to `repeat` which can take an expression.  Now we can enable grabbing arrays of values, so we can use that, instead.  Let's change this to:\n",

    "\n",
