    "# A little bit of endianness\n",
    "\n",
    "(Confession time: I did not even realize I was mildly-punning in that title.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few months, my hobby-time has mostly been focused on some reverse engineering of old DOS games I played as a kid.  The fruits of that will wait for another blog post, but this has led to some very fun investigations using the [DOSbox debugger](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=3944), [Ghidra](http://ghidra-sre.org/) and learning the Ghidra API to decompile MS-DOS system calls (especially [int 21h](http://bbc.nvg.org/doc/Master%20512%20Technical%20Guide/m512techb_int21.htm)) properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly fun aspect of doing all this, though, has been realizing just how much this has in common with the early stages of developing yt, when we had to reverse engineer file formats like it was going out of style.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that constantly *constantly* showed up in reverse engineering these formats was making sure our endianness was right.  Since we were often dealing with 32-bit values that had uncertain units, and where the values themselves could be quite the extreme and not *too* far from the limits of representation, it wasn't always immediately obvious if we had it right or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be completely honest, the thing that always threw me (and sometimes still does, when I'm thinking about ordering of numbers on the stack and in registers) is how numbers get represented as bits in memory, and more specifically, what the difference between \"big\" and \"little\" endian really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for a much better description and walkthrough, please feel free to visit the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).  Its load time is probably comparable to the reading time of this rather brief foray into views."

Let's try, by asking to view them in \"unsigned bytes\" format by using the `view` method with the argument `B` to indicate the dtype."
